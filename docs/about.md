# About the MSU-RSD

The Research Software Developers Group is a new, informal, grass-roots group for research software developers within the Michigan State University Community

Software is a crucial part of research and instruction, and the need to develop custom software (or modify existing tools to a new purpose) is increasingly a core component in the engine of innovation and scholarship at our university.    

Our goal is to create a community for those who write code to support all manner scholarly pursuits here at MSU.  We are supported by, but not affiliated with any MSU Unit or department.  


## We welcome: 

- all who code, not limited to those with computer science or engineering training or backgrounds.  
- who may not consider themselves professional 'engineers' even though they may spent time coding to support their work.  
- all kinds of coders, not limited (but including) to application or web development.  
- those from all disciplines who use software to acheive their scholarly goals, not limted to STEM fields.   Diverse scholarly activities often require equally diverse custom software.  
- those who code but may not consider themselves "programmers."  You may be an academic first and coder second but are interested in discussing and improving your software development skills
- builders, tinkerers, and creators of software that supports the research and academic missions of MSU
