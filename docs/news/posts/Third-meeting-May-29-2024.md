We anticipate the meeting will take approximately 90 minutes and you may drop in at any time.  Pizza, drinks, and snacks will be provided.    

We are looking for volunteers to present a project they are working on, or some technology they are using that they would like to talk about, or who would like to help with any other activities.

Agenda:

 1. General Announcements (anyone can make an announcement) 
 2. Presentations of Research or Software Projects ( seeking volunteers)
 3. Organizing social coding sessions for students and/or staff
 4. Collaborate on an RSD Resource list

 
Item 3:  To foster coding practices for new developers or students, we would like help organize a place and time for staff or students to work on their codes but in each other's company.

Item 4:  To help junior developers or those new to MSU, we would like to start a list of helpful resources for anyone building software for scholarly work on campus.   That could be a list or relevant associations, journals or other publications that directly speak to software development (Like [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/)).   Come with your ideas for what kinds of information we should share that would help fellow developers understand the landscape here at MSU.  

We'd love to know how many may be coming.   Please complete this short google form: https://forms.gle/vKLoKASqfMGhgYaY6 about your intention to attend (requires MSU google login, which may mean using a new private browser window).  If you've been forwarded this email and would like to join the mailing list, complete the form or contact us.  

We also have a [Microsoft Teams group](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19:tSltcSVQpNxg2S7iG6DLB3AJEUlHAVTy0v-s2TVRcek1@thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=ad060111-8356-4712-87ea-4df2736e14ad&tenantId=22177130-642f-41d9-9211-74237ad5687d).    The channel is open to anyone with a netid but you must request access. 

This announcement will also be sent to the MSU RSD mailing list and posted on our MS-Teams inlcuding the zoom link
