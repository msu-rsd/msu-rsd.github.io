An announcement will be sent to the MSU RSD mailing lists and posted on MSU Teams that will include a zoom link for remote participation.  

Drinks and afternoon snacks will be provided.  We are working on a sponsor for lunch -stay tuned!   Thanks again to ICER for sponsoring snacks for our previous meetings.  

As always (*n=2*), we anticipate the meeting will take approximately 90 minutes and you may drop in at any time.  

We are looking for volunteers to present the project they are working on, or for additional meeting agenda topics.   We will update this annoucement if anyone steps up to present.
