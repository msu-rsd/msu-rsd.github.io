# Hello world!


When I've been the sole software developer on a research team, I've often felt isolated and unsure that my work.   I lack the expertise of dedicated IT staff but may be on of the few  among this group with a research background.    

But in the last several years I've had the pleasure of working with many people on this campus and others who write custom software for scholary activities in many disciplines.   The term "Research Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_software_engineering)" (RSE) was coined in 2010 to encapsulate what many of us have been doing for years.   The US-RSE group formed years ago but had their first conference Fall 2023.   It was there that my colleague and I met our kindred spirits.   

That has motivated us to form a social group here on our campus to pursue locally the stated goals of the US-RSE: Community, Advocacy, Resources, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI).   

However we would like to cast a wider net to enourage many of those who may not consider themselves 'engineers' or who are shifting their focus and find themself writing software more an more.    I would not have considered myself an "engineer" years ago, but was just "the computer person" responsible for anything IT-related for research groups.   I you write software to get your scholarly work done and you are interested in the craft of software development, then you belong here.   I especailly want to support those who are from groups who are under-represented in the software development industry.  

To announce the group we've sent the following message out to mailing lists and members of the MSU community:
